If you want to use NTFS Undelete to restore your lost files, you will need a license key to activate the full version of the software. The full version allows you to recover unlimited files and access advanced features, such as previewing deleted files, filtering scan results, and saving scan sessions. However, the license key is not free and costs $29.95 for a single user license.
  
Fortunately, there are some ways to get a free license key for NTFS Undelete without paying anything. In this article, we will show you two methods to get a free license key for NTFS Undelete legally and safely.
  
## Method 1: Use a Giveaway or Promotion
  
One way to get a free license key for NTFS Undelete is to use a giveaway or promotion that offers the software for free. Sometimes, the developers of NTFS Undelete or some third-party websites may offer the software for free for a limited time or for a limited number of users. You can take advantage of these opportunities and get a free license key for NTFS Undelete by following the instructions on the giveaway or promotion page.

For example, in 2023, there was a giveaway on WinningPC.com that offered NTFS Undelete for free. To get the free license key, you had to visit the giveaway page, enter your name and email address, and click on "Get it now". Then, you would receive an email with the download link and the license key. You could use the license key to activate the full version of NTFS Undelete on your computer.
  
However, when using this method, you should be careful about the source and validity of the giveaway or promotion. Not all giveaways or promotions are legitimate or safe, and some may contain malware or viruses. You should always check the reputation and reviews of the website or the developer before participating in any giveaway or promotion. You should also read the terms and conditions of the giveaway or promotion carefully and make sure you understand what you are agreeing to.
  
## Method 2: Use a Crack or Keygen
  
Another way to get a free license key for NTFS Undelete is to use a crack or keygen. A crack is a modified version of the software that bypasses the activation process and allows you to use the full version without a license key. A keygen is a program that generates valid license keys for the software. You can use a crack or keygen to get a free license key for NTFS Undelete by downloading it from some websites that offer them.
  
For example, you can find a crack or keygen for NTFS Undelete on 4shared.com. To get the free license key, you had to download the crack or keygen file from the website, extract it from the archive, and run it on your computer. Then, you would get a license key that you could use to activate the full version of NTFS Undelete on your computer.
  
However, when using this method, you should be aware of the risks and consequences of using a crack or keygen. Using a crack or keygen is illegal and unethical, as it violates the intellectual property rights of the developers and distributors of NTFS Undelete. Using a crack or keygen may also damage your computer or compromise your data security, as it may contain malware or viruses. Using a crack or keygen may also result in legal actions or penalties from the developers or authorities.
  
## Conclusion
  
In this article, we have shown you two methods to get a free license key for NTFS Undelete: using a giveaway or promotion, and using a crack or keygen. Both methods have their advantages and disadvantages, and you should choose wisely depending on your situation and preference. However, we recommend that you support the developers of NTFS Undelete by purchasing the software from their official website if you find it useful and reliable.
